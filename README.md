HTML

HTML file consists mostly from div elements which doesn't meet accessibility standards. replaced "div" elements with semantic HTML elements.That also helped achieving logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When I view the image elements alt attributes were missing so I added them. When I view the heading attributes they fall in sequential order. When I view the title element it didn't define the title of the document. Then I replace existing title element with a concise, descriptive title.

CSS

CSS file had a lot of repetitive code. To achieve cleaner code I created classes for elements with same properties and values. Then I removed repetitive code.
